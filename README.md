This project was created to help us discover how well we could use a neural network to detect wether or not a given audio file was generated by artificial intelligence. The DeepVoiceDetection.ipynb jupyter file is the main file that was used to train, test, and run the nueral network. The model takes in the data from the DATASET-balanced.csv file to train.
